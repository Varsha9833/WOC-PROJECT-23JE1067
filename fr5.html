        <p>Thanks to everyone's amazing generosity, we are so pleased to be able to create an amazing memorial to Sid as his wife Simone requested. It has also been so touching to see how many young people have donated to this cause as well as friends and family from far and wide.
            Although we have hit a target that will allow us to build an amazing memorial it would be awesome to donate towards the cost of his wake and a gathering to celebrate the opening of the memorial once it is built.
            Again, on behalf of Simone and the family, it cannot be expressed how much it helps to know that we can honour Sid in a way that captures the wonderful man he was and the countless lives he made better.

            Sid McLean was a much-loved husband, father and community member. He was killed tragically in an accident last week while riding his bicycle. The loss has devastated all the people who knew him - not least his family - but also the very wide circle of friends and connections he had made over the years living in various parts of Australia including Gingin, Darwin, Broome, Derby, Geraldton, Lancelin and Perth.
            His loss will also be felt amongst the many community groups he was dedicated to - the Lancelin Ledge Point 'Pirates' Football Club, the Quinns 'Bulls' Football Club and Lancelin Boardriders.
            Sid was a person who exuded positivity and enthusiasm and always had a funny story to tell about something he had been part of at some point in his life.
            At the request of Simone and with the support of the community she would like to honour his life, wonderful spirit and contribution to Lancelin and so many other communities and sporting clubs with a lasting memorial bench. Something that reflects the incredible person that he was. We have in mind a bench symbolising the sea that he loved and also incorporating a tribute to his love for football.
            Details and location of the memorial are to be confirmed as we need to seek Shire approval however, we have a rough plan in mind, which his wife supports.
            Please know that all money raised will be put towards the real costs of this project and will be done with the full support of his wife, Simone. If there is any money left over after the project is complete it will be distributed as per Simone's wishes at the time. Letâ€™s make this memorial something amazing :)</p>
