        <p>I’m raising money for my friends family because at 1am on Sunday the 14th of January a family of 5 lost everything in a house fire, two members of the family unfortunately didn’t make it. I can’t imagine the stress and heartache they’re going through and I’d just like to take some pressure and stress away from them by creating this to help replace anything they may need. Funeral cost is going to be the last thing on their mind. Any help is much appreciated and please feel free to share</p>
