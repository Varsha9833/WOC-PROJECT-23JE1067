        <p>Our beloved Mr. Potter passed away unexpectedly on 1/17/2024. Jamie was an amazing wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend and overall person. She overcame some major obstacles in life including suffering a massive brain stem stroke 20 years ago. Jamie seemed to rise to every challenge, and somehow come out stronger. She had a gift for seeing the good in life and having gratitude for what really mattered. She could be described as the most genuine, kind, and funny (hilarious even) person most of us knew. To know Jamie was to love her.

            Jamieâ€™s greatest love in life was her family. If able, please consider a donation to help her husband Mark and their two beautiful girls Charlie (4) and Amelia (2) as they begin to navigate this unimaginable time without the support of their partner and mom.</p>
