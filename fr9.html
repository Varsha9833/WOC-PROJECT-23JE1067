        <p>This is Joshua Lewis, fundraising on behalf of my wonderful little sister, Isabella Mayer. I'd first like to thank all of our friends and family who have sent their love, prayers, and positive energy to Bella during this difficult time. I created this fundraiser to help ease the financial burdens that Bella will face as she moves into this next chapter of her life. Funds raised here will contribute to medical expenses, necessary lifestyle alterations, accessible housing, and any additional costs that may accompany her injury.</p>
