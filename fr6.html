        <p>Hello my dearest friends and followers, I am in a pretty stressful and depressing position and I’m humbly asking for your help. My soulmate, Hollywood, has been having seizures and I’m extremely nervous for his health and his current decline. His hospital bills are adding up and his pet insurance isn’t much help in this situation. For the emergency visit alone, it’s costing $3600 and that doesn’t include the cost of the medication and regularly scheduled blood tests. His vet had taken him off his meds without a back-up plan and his seizures continue to overwhelm his health. This last year was the first time he experienced seizures in his life, which lasted for 48 heartbreaking hours. Luckily, up until last night, he has been seizure-free for the last 8 months. Hollywood means everything to me and I love him with all my heart. I will do anything to help my best friend. He’s been by my side since the day I adopted him 12 years ago and his loyalty to me and love have gotten me through the darkest of times. I just want to be able to help him battle past these seizures like the little warrior he is. If you have any means of help, whether it be financial, financial advice, a relatable experience, or even just words of wisdom and hope, I’d be forever grateful. I appreciate any positive assistance in this matter and I hope you have a great day. Thank you for your time</p>
