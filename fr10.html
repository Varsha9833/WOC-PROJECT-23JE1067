        <p>Hello friend’s , and family

            My name is Anuj Bhardwaj and I am starting this campaign to expand my home based business in personalized merchandise. What started out as a fun craft during covid , has allowed me to step into something I love and have a absolute passion for.
            
            This past year has really been amazing and allowed me to set free my gift that I have been holding onto for so long. I am a mother of 4 wonderful children who share the same talents as I do. I am starting this campaign to raise funds to purchase 2 machines that will expand my business to a wider platform.
            
            The one thing in life that I strive to be is the best mother I can to my children. Expanding my home based business will allow me to be home and more available to them. “Lead By Example “ is a phrase that holds value to me, I strive to show my children a better way of life and encourage them to do what they love.
            
             All proceeds from this campaign will go to the purchase of my “DTF Printer and Industrial Embroidery machine. This will allow me to take my business to the next level.
