        <p>If you know my stepfather Mr. Batla, then you know how supporting, loving, and selfless she is! he is the heartbeat of our family and has touched so many lives from coast to coast. His laughter, love, and warmth has filled our hearts for years, and now it's our turn to give her heart the same in return!

            He is currently facing a heart condition that requires surgery, so we are currently aiming to raise $6000 to make sure she gets the support she needs. She is an amazing lady and we really want to see him get back to his vibrant self. Your generosity means the world to us. Any donation or simply sharing this page is helpful in our goal - thank you all and let's get our girl back on beat!</p>
